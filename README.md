# Product & Domain-Oriented Business Architecture Building Blocks

This collection of building blocks describes elements of business architecture which can be used to shape boundaries in software architecture and organization structure. By having a shared language of architecture building blocks you can spend more of your time improving the design resulting in a better-designed [socio-technical architecture](https://esilva.net/sociotechnical/sociotechnical-architecture_why-and-what.html) and greater alignment across an organization.

## Motivations

Excessive ambiguity in architecture terminology can lead to misalignment or time lost debating semantics. Both of these problems can result in a poorly designed architecture, and fundamental issues that impact the quality of customer experiences and the pace at which teams can deliver.

Some of the phrases used to describe architectural concepts originate from methodologies, frameworks, or communities. This can leave people feeling excluded from the conservation when they aren't familiar with these words and the definitions of these words is not easily accessible.

The purpose of this initiative is to address the above issues by providing clear definitions that people can use to describe components in their business, software, and organizational architecture.

## How to Use these Building Blocks

These building blocks can be used verbatim or customised to the particularities of your organization. You may decide to create your own architecture building blocks in which case this collection may serve merely as inspiration. The important outcome is being able to effectively design and communicate architecture in your organization.

## Relationship to other Frameworks

This collection of building blocks does not aim to dictate in any way the process or framework used to design architecture. It is purely a domain-specific language for describing architecture. There is no relationship to any business architecture frameworks, TOGAF, Domain-Driven Design, or any other proprietary or open frameworks. However, you can combine these building blocks with other frameworks and methodologies if you wish.
